# GPS-Z

[Global Pathway Selection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218016000638) (GPS) is an algorithm to effectively generates reduced (skeletal) chemistry mechanisms, which speeds up simulations and can be used as a systematic analytics tool to extract insights from complex reacting system.

This repo ([GPS-Z](https://github.com/llnl/GPS-Z)) is a fork of the original repository to use [Zero-RK](https://github.com/llnl/zero-rk) for accelerated solution of ignition delay problems. GPS-Z also uses python's multiprocessing library to enable parallel evaluation of GPS algorithm tasks.

## How to install
This repo is developed with Python 3.x and depends on many packages. The recommended way to install most dependencies is with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
* You can simply set up the environment by typing `conda env create -f env.yml`.

The user will also need to provide an installation of Zero-RK by following instructions in the [Zero-RK repo](https://github.com/llnl/zero-rk).  After Zero-RK is installed, GPS-Z will try to find the IDT executable by examining environment variable `ZERORK_HOME`, which should point to the Zero-RK installation folder.

## How to use
* Activate the anaconda environment: `conda activate gps`
* Start GPS: `python GPS.py`

For a more detailed tutorial, please see [Tutorial_v1.0.0.pdf](https://github.com/golsun/GPS/blob/master/Tutorial_v1.0.0.pdf).

After the GPS project has been configured via the GUI, it can be run via the GUI or can also be run in "headless" mode to enable submitting jobs via a batch-scheduling system on HPC clusters.  An example job script is given below, but will need to be adapted to the user's cluster environment (e.g. moab, slurm, lfs, etc.).

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH ...

conda activate gps

export ZERORK_HOME=/path/to/zerork
export GPS_HOME=/path/to/GPS
export PYTHONPATH=${GPS_HOME}:${PYTHONPATH}

python ${GPS_HOME}/gps_headless.py project_dir/project.json >& gps.log
```

To improve the accuracy of reduced mechanisms, GPS considers all-generation relation between species, and minimizes the risk of broken pathways and dead-ends. This algorithm was originally developed by Prof. Wenting Sun's group at Georgia Tech [[link](http://sun.gatech.edu/)]
